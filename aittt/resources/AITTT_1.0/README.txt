PROGRAM INFO

It's a tic tac toe game against the computer: the program shows you
the computer learning from its own mistakes (when it looses a match,
it saves its moves and tries not to repeat them, to avoid loosing
again).
At the beginning of the game, the only thing the computer knows is
that it has to move where there are 2 other equal Xs or Os in the
same row. Obviously this is not enough to play well; ...game by game
it will learn not to loose at all.

HARDWARE REQUESTS

The game really runs better on ZX Spectrum systems (having a minimum
of 48 KB of RAM). By the way it is written in ANSI C and you can
compile it using every standard C compiler.
In this case you will loose the possibility to experience the very
great graphics from Luciano "Lucky" Costarelli and the incredible
sounds effects played by the ZX beeper.
The standard zip file provides a Microsoft Windows executable.

    ZX Spectrum:
        48 KB of RAM
    Other systems:
        No colors needed
        Minimum 40 columns text-only console or window

If you want to experience the ZX Spectrum version but you (what an
unlucky creature!) do not have such hardware, you can use emulators:
    http://www.zxspin.co.uk/ (Windows)
    http://www.ramsoft.bbk.org/realspec.html (Windows and DOS)
    http://bonanzas.rinet.ru/apps/EmuZWin_Eng.htm (Windows)
    http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/ (Linux / Unix / MacOS)
... you'll only have to load the .tzx file :-)

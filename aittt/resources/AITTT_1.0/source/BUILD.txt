To build this program

1) download and install a patched z88dk from http://www.z88dk.org/
2) run compile.bat
3) edit the provided .tzx file and put the result of the compilation,
   a tap file, inside it (you must substitute the binary code in the
   middle of it. I suggest ZX-Blockeditor for doing this:

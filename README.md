# Dan's SAM Coupé C programming stuff

Subtitled 'Adventures in Cross Compiling' - trying to get my old SAM C programs working in Z88DK and some new ones too!

Projects completed:

* A.I. Tic Tac Toe (SAM Coupé and ZX) - a simple Tic Tac Toe game by Marcello Zaniboni 

Projects ongoing:

* Dan's C Demo (SAM Coupé and ZX) - Awaiting support of some SAM features from Z88DK (mainly the POINT command so that the starfields work)
